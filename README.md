# My-SQL-Projects-Archive

---

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

This repository marks the beginning of my coding journey. Back in **2022**, I started exploring the world of programming through SQL, building several projects that laid a strong foundation in database management and querying. While I haven't worked with SQL extensively since then, I look back at these projects as a reminder of my humble beginnings.

### Current Focus  
Since those early days, Iâ€™ve transitioned into coding primarily with **Python**. Iâ€™m now focused on building exciting projects, experimenting with new tools, and embracing emerging technologies. While SQL isn't my main focus at the moment, Iâ€™m more than willing to dive back into it if a role requires me to revisit my roots and re-learn it. **Growth and adaptability are my top priorities!**

### Why Keep This?  
This repository remains here not just as a portfolio of my early work, but also as a testament to the progress Iâ€™ve madeâ€”and the progress Iâ€™m eager to achieve moving forward. **Itâ€™s a snapshot of where I started and a motivator for where I want to go.**
